21. Consider the following Verilog code using dataflow modeling
module Unknown (p,a,b,c);
output p;
input a,b,c;
wire q,r;
assign q=!((!a) && b && (!c));
assign r= !(a && (!b) && (!c));
and G1(p,q,r);
endmodule
If c = 0 the Boolean expression for p would be
A. NAND operation between variables a and b
B. NOR operation between variables a and b
C. XOR operation between variables a and b
D. XNOR operation between variables a and b

answer:D
